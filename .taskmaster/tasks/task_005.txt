# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement NLP Engine for Manager Profiler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the NLP engine to analyze manager communication styles using Hugging Face Transformers.
# Details:
Use `transformers` library with pre-trained models (e.g., BERT). Implement text classification for 5 communication styles. Integrate with email/Slack for historical analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Test accuracy with labeled datasets. Validate real-time detection with sample communications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Model selection and setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and configure the appropriate Hugging Face transformer model for personality classification.
### Details:
Research and choose a pre-trained NLP model suitable for text classification. Set up the model environment with necessary dependencies and configurations.

## 2. Text classification implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement the text classification pipeline using the selected model.
### Details:
Develop the code to process input text, feed it into the model, and interpret the output for personality classification. Ensure the pipeline is efficient and scalable.

## 3. Integration with communication platforms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Integrate the classification system with relevant communication platforms.
### Details:
Connect the NLP pipeline to platforms like Slack or email systems to analyze messages in real-time. Implement APIs or webhooks for seamless integration.

## 4. Accuracy testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Test the model's accuracy and performance.
### Details:
Conduct extensive testing using labeled datasets to ensure the model meets the 85%+ accuracy target. Implement fallback mechanisms for low-confidence predictions.

## 5. Real-time detection validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Validate the system's performance in real-time scenarios.
### Details:
Deploy the system in a controlled real-time environment to monitor its performance. Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to improve reliability.
