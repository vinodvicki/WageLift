# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Readiness Score ML Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the ML pipeline for calculating the Intelligent Readiness Score using XGBoost.
# Details:
Train XGBoost model on historical raise success data. Implement real-time scoring API. Include feature engineering and model evaluation.

# Test Strategy:
Validate model accuracy with test datasets. Test API endpoints with mock data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Data preparation and feature engineering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Prepare and clean the dataset, perform feature engineering to extract relevant features for the readiness scoring model.
### Details:
Include steps for handling missing data, outlier detection, normalization, and creation of derived features that may influence raise success.

## 2. Model training [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Train the XGBoost model using the prepared dataset to predict readiness scores.
### Details:
Implement cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensure the model achieves at least 70% correlation with actual raise success.

## 3. API implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop an API to serve the trained model for real-time readiness scoring.
### Details:
Ensure the API can handle real-time requests, is scalable, and includes necessary security and performance optimizations.

## 4. Model evaluation and testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Evaluate the model's performance and conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability and accuracy.
### Details:
Perform A/B testing, monitor model drift, and validate that the model maintains the required correlation threshold in production.
